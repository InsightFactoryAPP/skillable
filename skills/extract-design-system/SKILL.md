  Read a project's design language from source — tokens, light/dark themes,
  typography, spacing, layout shell, breakpoints, component idioms, icons,
  motion, and copy tone — and publish it once as a living design-system
  artifact (a browsable token and component gallery in every theme), plus a
  short drift report of hard-coded values that bypass the tokens. Other skills
  such as wireframe-feature can then reuse the published system instead of
  re-extracting it. Use whenever the user wants to document,
  extract, audit, or visualize their app's design system, build a style guide or
  component gallery from the codebase, or prepare a reusable design reference
  for wireframes, decks, or landing pages. Also triggers on
  /extract-design-system with an optional focus.

# Extract Design System

Goal: turn the design language that is scattered across a codebase into one page anyone can open — every token with its value per theme, every component idiom rendered live, and the rules that make the app look like itself. Extract once, reuse everywhere: wireframes, decks, landing pages, and onboarding all read from the same published system.

## When to use

- "Document / extract / visualize our design system"
- "Build a style guide or component gallery from the code"
- "Which colors and spacing do we actually use? Where do we bypass the tokens?"
- Before a run of `wireframe-feature`, so every wireframe starts from the same reference
- `/extract-design-system [focus=tokens|components|all]`
- Not for designing a *new* visual identity (use frontend-design) or changing the project's styles.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Focus | `all` | `tokens` = foundations only; `components` = foundations + gallery; `all` adds layout shell, patterns, and drift report. |
| Project | current repo | Monorepo: ask which app if several have their own UI, or pick the one with the most UI code and say so. |

Do not run a questionnaire. Note assumptions in the report.

## 1. Inventory in parallel

Read the sources of truth, not compiled CSS. [references/design-extraction.md](references/design-extraction.md) lists where to look per stack.

When the agent can run subagents (e.g. Claude Code's Agent tool), split the reading into parallel read-only passes and merge the results — each returns a structured note, not file dumps:

1. **Foundations** — color tokens per theme and the theme-switching mechanism, typography (families, sources, scale, weights, line heights), spacing scale, radii, shadows, borders, z-layers, breakpoints, motion (durations, easings).
2. **Components** — the UI kit directory (`components/ui`, `packages/ui`…): each component's variants, sizes, and states; the icon set; empty, loading, error, and toast idioms.
3. **Shell and patterns** — root layout, navigation (real labels and order), page header, content width, responsive behavior per breakpoint, forms, tables vs. cards, dialogs and drawers.
4. **Voice** — copy tone from real UI strings (buttons, empty states, errors): sentence vs. title case, person, terminology for core entities.

Without subagents, do the same passes one after another.

## 2. Normalize

Build one model of the system, keeping the **project's own names**:

- Tokens as `name → value per theme`, grouped (color / type / space / radius / shadow / motion / breakpoint). Resolve aliases (`--primary: var(--blue-600)`) but show the chain.
- Semantic vs. primitive tokens: mark which ones components actually reference.
- Components as `name → variants × sizes × states`, with the source path of each.
- A short **rules** list stated as do/don't, derived from the code ("Primary buttons are always full-width on mobile", "Destructive actions confirm in a dialog, never inline").

If the project has only one theme, document only that one. If it has no real token layer (raw hex in components), say so and present the de-facto palette sorted by usage count.

## 3. Detect drift

Search for values that bypass the system and count them per file:

```bash
# Hard-coded colors in components and styles (adjust globs per stack)
rg -n -g '!node_modules' -g '!*.svg' -g '!**/tokens*' -e '#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}\b' -e 'rgba?\(' -e 'hsla?\(' src app components packages 2>/dev/null
# Arbitrary Tailwind values
rg -n -g '!node_modules' -e '\[(#|[0-9]+px)' src app components 2>/dev/null
```

Report the top offenders (file, count, nearest token) and near-duplicate tokens (two grays within a few ΔE, spacing values off the scale). Do **not** fix them in this skill — list them so the user can decide.

## 4. Build the design-system page

One self-contained HTML page (no build step, no network calls except fonts and pinned CDN libraries):

- **Tokens on `:root`** with the project's names, second theme under the project's own mechanism (`.dark`, `[data-theme="dark"]`…) and `prefers-color-scheme` by default, plus a visible **theme toggle**.
- **Foundations** — color swatches (name, value per theme, contrast ratio against its usual background, and a pass/fail flag at WCAG AA), type scale specimens, spacing and radius rulers, shadow tiles, motion demos, breakpoint table.
- **Components** — each component rendered live in every variant, size, and state (hover/focus/disabled/loading/error), with its source path and usage notes. Recreate them in plain HTML/CSS with the extracted tokens; they must look like the real ones.
- **Shell and patterns** — the layout shell at mobile and desktop widths, form, table/list, dialog, empty/loading/error patterns, with the real nav labels.
- **Voice** — tone rules and before/after copy examples.
- **Drift** — the findings from step 3.
- A sticky in-page nav and a search box that filters tokens and components.
- Responsive: no horizontal scroll at 375 px.

## 5. Publish and record

- **Artifact-capable agent** (e.g. Claude Code with an artifact tool): if the agent offers a **Design System** artifact type, create the system from that type and fill it with the extracted foundations and components; otherwise publish the page from step 4 as an artifact titled `<Project> Design System`. Republish to the same URL on later runs so links stay stable.
- **Otherwise:** write `design-system-<project>.html` outside the tracked tree (a scratch/temp directory) and open it locally.
- **Record the location** so other skills find it: offer to add one line to the project's agent instructions file (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.cursor/rules`), e.g. `Design system: <url> (generated by extract-design-system on <date>)`. Only write it when the user agrees, and commit it only if they ask.

## 6. Report

```markdown
**<Project> design system** · themes: <list> · <N> tokens · <M> components · <link>

**Foundations:** <one line each: palette, type, spacing, radius, motion, breakpoints>
**Theme mechanism:** <e.g. next-themes, class="dark" on <html>>
**Drift:** <K> hard-coded values in <F> files — top 3: <file (count) → nearest token>
**Contrast:** <pairs failing WCAG AA, or "all pass">
**Assumptions:** <bullets>
**Reuse:** wireframe-feature reads this system when it is recorded in <file>.
```

## 7. Refresh

On a later run, diff against the published version: list added, removed, and changed tokens and components, then republish in place. Never create a second artifact for the same project unless asked.

## Quality bar before reporting

- [ ] Every token shown with the project's own name and its value in every theme
- [ ] Theme toggle switches every surface; no hard-coded colors in the page itself
- [ ] Components rendered live in all their variants and states, each with a source path
- [ ] Drift findings cite files and counts; nothing in the project was modified
- [ ] No secrets, internal URLs, or real user data in the page
