# Comparison report: metrics and scoring

Measure every variant with the same commands, from its own worktree, after all variants are done. Record raw values first; score second.

## Hard metrics

| Metric | How | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acceptance | Run only the shared acceptance tests | `passed/total`. Any failure caps the variant's verdict at "failed". |
| Existing suite | Full test command | Compare with the baseline: new failures are regressions; pre-existing failures are not the variant's fault. |
| Lint / typecheck / build | Project commands | `ok` or error count. |
| Diff size | `git diff --shortstat spike/<feature>...spike/<feature>-<x> -- . ':!*lock*' ':!<shared-tests>'` | Smaller is not automatically better — note it, then judge fit. |
| Files touched | `git diff --name-only …` | Flag edits outside the expected area. |
| New dependencies | Diff of the manifest(s) | Name, version, license, install size (`npm view <pkg> dist.unpackedSize`, bundlephobia-style estimate, or `cargo tree`). |
| Bundle / binary delta | Project build output, `du -b` of the artifact, or the bundler's stats | Only when the project ships a bundle or binary. |
| Bench | The user's `bench` command, 1 warm-up + 5 runs, report the median and spread | Same machine, sequentially, nothing else running. |
| Test duration | Wall time of the suite | Catches approaches that slow CI. |

## Soft metrics (orchestrator's review)

Read each variant's diff in full and rate 1–4:

- **Fit** — follows the codebase's existing patterns, naming, layering, and error handling.
- **Clarity** — a teammate could review and maintain it without the spike's context.
- **Extensibility** — how it handles the next likely requirement (name that requirement).
- **Risk** — migration, concurrency, security, or operational risk it introduces (4 = lowest risk).

Justify each rating with one sentence and a file reference.

## Verdict

- **Failed** — acceptance tests fail, or the build is broken.
- **Viable** — passes everything; trade-offs to weigh.
- **Recommended** — the viable variant with the best balance for *this* project's priorities. State the priorities you assumed (e.g. "small bundle over flexibility").

Never average soft and hard metrics into one number; show them side by side and explain the recommendation in words.

## Page layout

1. Header — feature, base commit, baseline test result, date.
2. Scorecard table — one row per variant, hard metrics then soft ratings, verdict badge.
3. Recommendation — one paragraph, plus the runner-up and when it would win.
4. Variant cards — thesis, metrics, 2–4 key diff hunks (syntax highlighted, collapsed by default), dependencies added, notes and known gaps, and `git switch spike/<feature>-<x>` / worktree path to inspect locally.
5. Acceptance criteria — the shared contract, with a pass/fail matrix per variant.

Light and dark themes, readable at phone width, no network calls beyond a pinned syntax-highlighting library.
