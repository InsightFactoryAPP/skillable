# ⚡ Skillable

**Teach your AI agent the workflows you're tired of repeating.**

A curated, community-driven collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) — plain-markdown playbooks that turn "explain it to the agent again" into a single slash command. Built on the open `SKILL.md` format, so they work with Cursor, Claude Code, and [any skills-capable agent](https://agentskills.io/clients).

Your agent is smart. It just doesn't know *your* routines: how you triage Dependabot PRs, what "fix CI" actually means in your world, which steps a Node upgrade always forgets. Skills fix that. Each one is a self-contained folder of markdown instructions the agent discovers automatically — no prompt copy-pasting, no re-explaining, no drift between sessions.

## ☕ The morning routine, automated

The flagship demo — skills that call other skills. One command sweeps your entire GitHub account:

```text
you:    /sweep-all-dependency-prs

agent:  Listing every repo you own (and your orgs') …
        ├── repo-a → 3 bot PRs → /sweep-dependency-prs
        │     ├── #41 CI green ✅ → approved & merged
        │     ├── #42 CI green ✅ → approved & merged
        │     └── #43 CI red ❌ → /fix-renovate-pr → pushed fix → green → merged
        ├── repo-b → 1 bot PR → merged ✅
        └── report: 12 PRs merged, 2 fixed, 1 needs you
```

`sweep-all` fans out to `sweep`, which delegates red builds to `fix-renovate-pr` / `fix-dependabot-pr`. Composable playbooks, not one mega-prompt.

## 🚀 Quick start

Install with the [skills CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/agent-resources/skills). It detects which agents you have (Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cline, and [18+ others](https://agentskills.io/clients)) and puts the skills where they look.

**Every skill, on every project on this machine:**

```bash
npx skills add -g marc-aurele-besner/skillable
```

**This project only** (committed with the repo, shared with your team):

```bash
npx skills add marc-aurele-besner/skillable
```

**One skill:**

```bash
npx skills add marc-aurele-besner/skillable --skill sweep-dependency-prs
```

Useful extras:

```bash
npx skills add marc-aurele-besner/skillable --list   # preview without installing
npx skills find skillable                            # search the public directory
```

Start a **new agent session** after installing. Skills load from their `description` when the task matches, or you can invoke one directly as `/skill-name`.

<details>
<summary>Manual install (clone and copy)</summary>

If you can't run the CLI, copy skill folders into your agent's skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marc-aurele-besner/skillable.git
cp -r skillable/skills/* ~/.cursor/skills/   # Cursor
cp -r skillable/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/   # Claude Code
```

Share one skill with your team by dropping it into the project:

```bash
cp -r skillable/skills/<skill-name> .cursor/skills/   # or .claude/skills/, etc.
```

Using a different agent? Same idea — see the [client list](https://agentskills.io/clients) for its skills path.

## 🔍 Anatomy of a skill

```text
skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md          # Required — frontmatter (name, description) + instructions
├── scripts/          # Optional — helper scripts the agent can run
├── references/       # Optional — longer docs loaded on demand
└── assets/           # Optional — templates and other static files
```

A good skill has four traits:

- **One specific purpose** — a clear workflow, not a catch-all prompt dump
- **A trigger-rich description** — tells the agent *when* to reach for it, unprompted
- **A concise body** — assume the agent is smart; only add what it wouldn't know
- **Progressive disclosure** — keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines; push depth into `references/`

Authoring a new one? Copy [`templates/skill/`](templates/skill/) into `skills/<your-skill-name>/` — it lives outside `skills/` so the CLI does not install the placeholder.

## 🤝 Contributing

Got a workflow you've explained to an agent more than twice? That's a skill waiting to be written. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for naming conventions, review criteria, and the submission process — then open a PR.

## ⭐ Support the project

If a skill here just merged a week's worth of bot PRs while you drank your coffee, **star the repo** — it's how other people find it, and it keeps new skills coming.
